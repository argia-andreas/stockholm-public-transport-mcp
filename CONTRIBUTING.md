# Contributing to Stockholm Traffic MCP Server

We welcome contributions to the Stockholm Traffic MCP Server! This guide will help you get started with contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip
- Git

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stockholm-traffic-mcp.git
   cd stockholm-traffic-mcp
   ```

3. **Set up the development environment:**
   ```bash
   # Using uv (recommended)
   uv sync --dev
   
   # Or using pip
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. **Create a new branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

We use pytest for testing. Run the full test suite with:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

For verbose output:
```bash
uv run pytest -v
```

### Code Quality

We use ruff for linting and formatting. Before submitting your changes:

```bash
# Check for linting issues
uv run ruff check

# Fix auto-fixable issues
uv run ruff check --fix

# Format code
uv run ruff format
```

### Testing Your Changes

1. **Run the server locally:**
   ```bash
   uv run mcp dev server.py
   ```

2. **Test with MCP inspector** to verify your changes work correctly

3. **Add tests** for any new functionality you implement

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes
